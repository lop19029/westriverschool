              <h1>More than a School</h1>
              <p>West River University has a variety of academic, co-curricular, 
                  and well-being programs to suit all of our unique and diverse students. 
                  We have a strong history, turning students into professionals since 1970.
                  Our students receive a complete and personalized education that provides wide 
                  exposure to arts, athletics, and academics. We believe that participating in these 
                  programs has a vital role in the creative and social development of our students, 
                  fostering skills and abilities such as concentration, and improved memory, 
                  which can then be applied in many other areas of our studentâ€™s lives. 
                  Participation in sporting activity, in addition to developing general and specific 
                  physical skills, promotes values such as teamwork, self-discipline, friendship, 
                  respect, and cooperation.
                  At West River University, you will be part of more than a School of business. 
                  You will develop yourself as an individual, who will be able to identify him or 
                  herself as a key part of society.</p></div>
